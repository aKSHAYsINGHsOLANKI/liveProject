# liveProject
This was my first live project which I had worked on using technologies like  Nodejs  and Reactjs.
This project was  developed for local institutions in which Superadmin could hold and maintain students
record like NewStudent,FEES,BATCHES,COURSES,SubAdmin etc and could also assign different sub-admins for institutions.
In this project , as a full stack developer I had developed most of the modules (using Nodejs and Reactjs) and provided
support in handling Database System(using MySQL).
